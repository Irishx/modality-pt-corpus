Modality in Text - a Portuguese Corpus manually annotated, and its annotation guidelines (linguistic modality).

This reposity contains 3 Portuguese corpus samples that are manually annotated with modality. Each subfolder stores the annotation guidelines for modality annotation in Portuguese and a corpus that is manually annotated with modality following those guidelines, stored in the MMAX2 XML annotation format.


The modality corpus 1 Version 1.0 for Portuguese is a sample of 1946 sentences extracted from the written part of the Corpus de Referência do Português Contemporâneo (CRPC) (Généreux et
al., 2012), a highly diverse corpus of 312 million words covering a large variety of textual genres and Portuguese varieties. We extracted the sentences on the basis of a list of 40 Portuguese verbs that can express a modal meaning.  Version1.1.0 corresponds to the version that is connected to the paper by Hendrickx et al (2012).

The modality corpus 1 Version 2.0 presents the same 1946 sentences as Version 1.0 but annotated with a slightly modified version of the modality annotation schema in line with the published unified schema detailed in Ávila et al. (2015).

TThe CRPC-Modal Corpus composed of full-text files, extracted from the written subpart of the Reference Corpus of Contemporary Portuguese (Généreux et al, 2012). Most texts are
news articles, but there are also a few fiction and scientific texts, and texts from varia. Contrary to Modality Corpus 1, where single sentences were extracted and annotated, in the CRPC--Modal Corpus, the annotator had access to the full text and could consider the larger context to disambiguate the modal values. TThe CRPC-Modal Corpus is annotated with the annotation guidelines Version 3.0 follows the slightly modified version of the modality annotation scheme presented in version 2.0, in line with the published unified schema detailed in Ávila et al. (2015).
