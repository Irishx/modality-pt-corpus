The modality corpus 1 Version 1.0 for Portuguese is a sample of 1946 sentences extracted from the written part of the Corpus de Referência do Português Contemporâneo (CRPC) (Généreux et al., 2012), a highly diverse corpus of 312 million words covering a large variety of textual genres and Portuguese varieties. We extracted the sentences on the basis of a list of 40 Portuguese verbs that can express a modal meaning. Version1.1.0 corresponds to the version that is connected to the paper by Hendrickx et al (2012).
